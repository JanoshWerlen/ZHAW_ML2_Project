The goal of the project stems from the problem that legal documents are large in size and interwoven. 
Oftentimes, questions are hard to link to the right and relevant articles. 
One reason for this is that titles of articles are often not precise enough for the average person to find the answers they need. 
Furthermore, it usually takes a lot of time to find the right content, 
especially when multiple legal documents are connected and therefore need to be consulted together.

The goal of this project, therefore, is to create a RAG-Bot that can take user inputs in the form of a legal question and return relevant articles and provide responses that can help the user continue their research. 
It is important to state that AI itself should NOT be used to provide legally binding responses. So the response should only be seen as a way to find the most relevant legal texts that should be consulted by the users themselves.

My personal motivation derives from my employment in HR, where many employees are very unfamiliar with the legal bases they need to adhere to. 
Also, many of the employees within HR need to dedicate time to find the right legal groundwork when responding to questions posed by other employees. 
This bot can help reduce the research time by finding and providing relevant articles that correspond to the question at hand.
